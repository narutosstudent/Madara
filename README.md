# Madara ✍️

A way for people to manage their tasks 🗒️

## Process and Goal 💪

Madara was designed in Figma 🖌️

I focused heavily on Testing, UX, and Accessibility 😄

The past 3 months were a deep dive into Accessibility, so throughout the process, I continuously improved and redesigned the project 🔥

My favorite part with this project, aside from the Accessibility stuff I've learned, was implementing the Drag and Drop feature 🥳

It was also really fun writing the various custom hooks 👏

My main inspiration for this project was Github Project 😁

I'm really happy right now to have finally finished it, sometimes it felt like it was never gonna be finished due to the number of accessibility improvements you can make 🦊 🔥 🎊 🎉

## Installation 🛠️

After cloning the project, you need to run `yarn` 🔧

This project uses 7 environment variables, which you can retrieve after creating a Firebase project. 🤠
<br>
Create a `.env.development.local` file in the root folder. 💫
<br>
<br>
The environment variables it should have:
<br>
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_KEY`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_APP_ID`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_AUTH_DOMAIN`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_PROJECT_ID`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_STORAGE_BUCKET`
